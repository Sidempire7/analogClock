# analogClock

The Analog Clock project is a web-based implementation of a classic analog clock. Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project provides a visually appealing representation of time with moving clock hands that mimic the functionality of a traditional analog clock.
Analog clocks offer a simple and intuitive way to visualize time, and this project adds a touch of interactivity and style to that concept.
The clock features three moving hands representing the hour, minute, and second.
The clock hands move smoothly and continuously, creating a natural and visually pleasing animation effect.
